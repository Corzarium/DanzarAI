However, at least from Dec 2022, there is a bug when using this strategy with Plume of PursuitPlume of PursuitBone CircletEnergy Shield: (64-92)Requires Level 64, 73 Int(30-20)% reduced Cast Speed(80-130)% increased Energy ShieldNon-critical strikes deal 80% less DamageSpell Skills always deal Critical Strikes on final RepeatSpell Skills cannot deal Critical Strikes except on final RepeatA dance as old as time.. Instead of causing the whole Blade Vortex effect to either always critically strike or never critically strike, it will merely allow the Blade Vortex effect to critically strike as if Plume of PursuitPlume of PursuitBone CircletEnergy Shield: (64-92)Requires Level 64, 73 Int(30-20)% reduced Cast Speed(80-130)% increased Energy ShieldNon-critical strikes deal 80% less DamageSpell Skills always deal Critical Strikes on final RepeatSpell Skills cannot deal Critical Strikes except on final RepeatA dance as old as time. were not equipped. Note also that Intensity updates on each cast[1], and stats that apply per hit instead of per cast do not snapshot. Visual effect: Blade vortex's visual effect does not scale with Area of effect modifiers. Instead, to give a rough indication of radius, there are several versions of the knife effect, each rotating at a different radius. The skill will always try to have one knife using the largest-radius effect that's not larger than the actual radius of the skill, but that skill results in discrete visual changes where you need to reach a certain threshold before the next wider effect can be used. The full radius is always used mechanically.[2] Blade Vortex's in-game tooltip DPS gives the average damage of one hit from one Blade Vortex instance, multiplied by casts per second. This value is misleading primarily because Blade Vortex can hit more than once over its duration, thus cast speed must not be used, but hits per second (rounds per second, spin rate), over the duration of the stacks. Base spin rate of Blade Vortex is 600 ms. Blade Vortex hit more frequently with more stacks it has. As gem says: 35% increased Hit Rate for each blade. So spin time is calculated as S p i n T i m e = B a s e S p i n T i m e ( 1 + S p i n T i m e R e d u c t i o n × S t a c k s C o u n t ) \color [rgb]{0.6392156862745098,0.5529411764705883,0.42745098039215684}SpinTime={BaseSpinTime \over (1+SpinTimeReduction\times StacksCount)} R o u n d s P e r S e c o n d = 1 S p i n T i m e = ( 1 + S p i n T i m e R e d u c t i o n × S t a c k s C o u n t ) B a s e S p i n T i m e \color [rgb]{0.6392156862745098,0.5529411764705883,0.42745098039215684}RoundsPerSecond={1 \over SpinTime}={(1+SpinTimeReduction\times StacksCount) \over BaseSpinTime} Assuming spin rate increases for 35% for each stack, we have the following data: Each stack of Blade Vortex increases hit damage with the following formula: H i t D a m a g e = B a s e H i t D a m a g e × ( 1 + F × S t a c k s C o u n t ) \color [rgb]{0.6392156862745098,0.5529411764705883,0.42745098039215684}HitDamage={BaseHitDamage\times {(1+F\times StacksCount)}} Where F {\textstyle \color [rgb]{0.6392156862745098,0.5529411764705883,0.42745098039215684}F} is per-stack damage increase factor. Then we need just multiply hits per second with hit damage.
