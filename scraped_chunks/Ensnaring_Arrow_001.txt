Ensnaring Arrow is a bow attack skill which fires an arrow that tethers to the ground behind the enemy it hits, debuffing it with Snared. The ensnared enemy has less movement speed per snare (up to 3), takes increased hit damage from projectile attacks. Snares are removed when the enemy moves out of the arrow's area of effect. Split/Pierce/Fork/Chain/Return: Ensnaring Arrow cannot ensnare an enemy if the arrow continues from the enemy due to any projectile behaviours. Arrows that pierce or fork will never ensnare a target. Returning arrows can ensnare an enemy if the arrow collides and stops at that enemy. Arrows that have remaining chains can ensnare an enemy if there are no other eligible enemies to chain to. Ensnaring Arrow can drop anywhere.
