Meat Shield Support is a support gem for minion skills. It changes the minions' behaviour to be defensive, causing them to stay close to their owner and prioritise attacking close enemies by lowering their aggro radius. It also causes the supported minions to take less damage, grants increased movement speed, a chance to taunt on hit, and grants them more damage against enemies near you.
