Suppport Gems are a type of Gem in Path of Exile 2 (PoE 2). Support Gems are designed to modify and enhance the effects of the Skill Gems they are linked to. Unlike Skill Gems, Support Gems do not have active abilities of their own; instead, they adjust the properties of a Skill Gem in various ways. These modifications allow players to tailor their skills to their preferred playstyle. Support Gems can also add additional effects such as increased damage, increased range, or other situational bonuses. Support Gems enhance Skill Gems in unique and impactful ways, offering greater customization for character builds. Over a hundred new Support Gems are being introduced, expanding strategic possibilities even further. Haemocrystals: introduce a fresh approach to bleed-focused builds, converting damage over time into devastating Vaal crystal explosions. Alignment: empowers Bow Attacks, rewarding precise positioning and tactical movement. Caltrops: scatters hazardous traps across the battlefield, hindering enemies' movement while spears tear through their ranks. Many more options cater to diverse playstyles, including Enormity, Unsteady Tempo, Profanity, Retaliate, Syzygy, and others yet to be unveiled.
