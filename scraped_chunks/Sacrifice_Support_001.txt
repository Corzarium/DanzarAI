If 20% of current life cannot be removed (e.g. maximum life is 1 due to Chaos Inoculation), the spell can still be used and will lower the player to 1 life, but will lose part or all of the additional base damage scaling from life.[1] This support gem has some synergies with Dissolution of the FleshDissolution of the FleshCrimson JewelLimited to: 1Removes all Energy ShieldLife that would be lost by taking Damage is instead Reserveduntil you take no Damage to Life for 2 seconds(20-30)% more Maximum Life"We awoke to a sudden dawn cresting through the mountains.Each peak rose into searing fire, a massive roiling tide.A great eye gazed upon us, and we became known - utterly."Place into an allocated Jewel Socket on the Passive Skill Tree.

This combination prevents sacrificing your life from interrupting life recharge, allows you to recharge 100% of your life per second, and allows you to maximize the amount of life sacrificed each cast as long as you cast less than 5 times per second (you will recharge to full before the next cast). Sources of life recovery rate can be used to push the life recharge even higher, allowing higher cast rates. However, life becoming reserved will interrupt life recharge if the unreserved maximum life becomes lower than your current life.[2] When life is paid or sacrificed to a skill's cost, your life total after you have paid the spell's cost is used to determine properties of the skill. This means that a character using a skill supported by Sacrifice can gain the benefit of Pain Attunement, or any other similar modifier, if the cost of using that skill brings them to Low Life. Proxy: Totems are the only proxy that can be supported with this gem. Totems will sacrifice their own life when casting and scales with totem life modifiers. Divine Shrine: As Sacrifice Support sacrifices life rather than causing the player to take damage, being affected by a Divine Shrine will not prevent life loss. Sacrifice Support can drop anywhere.
