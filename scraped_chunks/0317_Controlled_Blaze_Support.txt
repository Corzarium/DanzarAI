Controlled Blaze is a support gem that causes melee attacks to have an increased chance to ignite and for each Ignite inflicted with the Skill recently, it deals less Damage but more Ignite Damage. Controlled Blaze will count all hits that have applied ignite, for each monster that received an ignite and any ignite that has been re-applied to an already ignited enemy. Due to the fact that more and less modifiers are multiplicative, Controlled Blaze will provide less DPS at high number of ignites applied recently. Depending on the gem level, the number of ignites you need to inflict to reach its highest damage bonus is 12 or 13.[2] This results in a "sweet spot" of 3 to 3.25 attacks per second (assuming no other targets); however, it is better to exceed this value to account for time not spent attacking while dodging/repositioning. That said, in general, you can be about 4 ignites off from the optimal range before you start experiencing a >5% ignite DPS loss. Controlled Blaze Support can drop anywhere.
