Automation is a hybrid gem. While the Automation skill is active, skills supported by Automation Support trigger immediately and automatically once off cooldown. It supports instant spells without a reservation. It cannot support skills used by totems, traps, or mines. Automation can support multiple instant spells at once. Each skill will be used off cooldown independently. Note that most guard skills and instant movement skills share cooldowns, preventing subsequent linked skills of that category from triggering.
