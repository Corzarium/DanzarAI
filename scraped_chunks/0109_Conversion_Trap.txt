Conversion Trap throws a trap that causes the enemy that triggered it to temporarily become allies with the user. Most normal, magic, and rare rarity monsters can be converted into temporary allies using this skill, but unique monsters cannot. Magic and rare monsters that are converted keep all of their monster modifier effects, including aura like effects. Converted monsters also retain all buffs and debuffs that were present on the monster prior to conversion. Duration: Modifiers to skill duration affect the duration of enemy's conversion state. Modifiers to buff and debuff duration or expiry rate do not apply. Hostile totems can be turned into allies using Conversion Trap. Auras from the totem will affect the player and a Shockwave Totem will attack the player's enemies. Temporary allies: Monsters converted by Conversion Trap are not considered minions and do not scale with minion-specific stats or minion support gems. In PvP content, Conversion Trap can not affect players; however, their minions can be converted.[1] Warriors found in the Trial of the Ancestors cannot be converted. Conversion Trap can drop anywhere.
