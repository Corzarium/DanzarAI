Manaforged Arrows is a support gem that triggers a linked bow attack skill when the player spends enough mana on other bow attacks. Supported Skills Trigger once total Mana Spent on other Bow Attacks exceeds 300% of their Mana Cost: tracks cumulative mana spent on all bow attack skills, including ballista totem skills, traps, and mines that use bow skills. "Their" refers to "Supported Skills", not "other Bow Attacks". That is, the threshold is 300% of the mana cost of each supported skill, not 300% of the mana cost of the other bow attacks. Example: Tornado Shot is linked to Manaforged Arrows Support and costs 14 mana. Those 14 mana times 300% are 42 mana, which is the threshold. The other bow skill you are using is barrage (not supported by manaforged arrows support) and costs 6 mana. After attacking for the 7th time (7*6=42) you have reached the threshold and Tornado Shot will trigger.

Reducing the mana cost of the triggered skill to zero by other means also works. (However, the mana cost of the other bow skill must still be nonzero for this to work.)
