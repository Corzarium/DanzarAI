Flesh and Stone is an aura skill that activates Blood and Sand Stance. In Blood Stance (Flesh), the aura debuffs nearby enemies to take more physical damage from hits. In Sand Stance (Stone), the user is buffed to take less hit damage from entities inside the aura. Both effects are stronger the closer enemies are to the user. Activating the skill while it's toggled on will alternate between stances. Certain skills also behave differently based on the stance you are currently in. Nearby: Enemies within 1.5 metres of the user receive the full effect, which scales linearly down to 0 at the edge of the area. Increasing the aura's radius only affects the edge of the area and does not affect the 1.5 metre range for maximum effect. Increasing the aura radius does affect the interpolation between the two circles, however.[1] Aura effect: Aura effect will scale the Nearby Enemies take up to 10% more Physical Damage from Hits while in Blood Stance stat, but not Take up to 10% less Damage from Nearby Enemies while in Sand Stance; the less Damage taken stat is an effect of the buff, not the aura.
