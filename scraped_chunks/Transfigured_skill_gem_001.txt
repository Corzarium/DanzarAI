Transfigured skill gems are alternate versions of existing skill gems, denoted by having "of X" as a suffix that alters its function and balance. While they are technically the same item as their default versions, they can often drastically change the identity of the skill, even changing its gem tags and mechanics. The transfigured gem system, introduced in 3.23, replaced three older systems [1] that enhanced or altered the effects of skills: alternate quality gems, labyrinth helmet enchantments, and unique threshold jewels. It also took, or took inspiration, from prior league systems, such as 3.21's Crucible Passive Tree notables. Transfigured gems that have been corrupted to grant a Vaal skill will provide the transfigured base skill and Vaal skill. Vaal versions of skills do not have transfigurations.[2] Trigger cooldowns are shared between multiple skills of the same type, including any transfigurations. Skill microtransactions are compatible with their respective transfigured versions.[3] Within stash tabs, transfigured gems can be searched by searching for "transfigured" or any set of characters composing the word, including "trans" or "sfi". Using the Divine Font at the end of the Labyrinth allows players to obtain transfigured gems with varying degrees of randomness. There are 185 transfigured skill gems.
