Support Gems, also known as simply supports, are an item class of gems used to modify the behaviours of supported skill gems. Previously known as support skill gems, their name was changed to prevent confusion as supports are not actually skills. Instead of granting a specific skill like skill gems do, support gems modify any compatible skill gem linked to the support, modifying its behaviours as well as applying a mana cost multiplier. Many support-skill gem combinations are invalid; for example, a ClarityClarityAura, Spell, AoELevel: (1-20)Reservation: (34-279) ManaCooldown Time: 1.20 secCan Store 1 Use(s)Cast Time: InstantAoE Radius: 36Requires Level 10Casts an aura that grants mana regeneration to you and your allies.+(0-1.9) metres to radiusYou and nearby Allies Regenerate (2.9-33) Mana per second Additional Effects From 1-20% Quality: (2-40)% increased Area of EffectPlace into an item socket of the right colour to gain this skill.

Please note that gem tags do not determine the supportability.[1] Multiple skill gems may be linked to a single support gem, in which case the support will modify all supported skills. Multiple support gems may be linked to a skill gem, in which case the skill gem will be modified by all of the supports. However, if two copies of a given support gem are linked to the same skill, only the higher level gem will apply. If a body armour contains two copies of a skill gem linked to different sets of support gems, two separate versions of the skill will be available, each with their own modifications. This may be desirable if for instance one version has been modified for single target damage, while another has been modified for area of effect damage. Support Gems add an icon in the form of a coloured letter or symbol to any supported skills' icons on the Skill Bar. Support gems with a given gem tag (e.g. fire/minion) do not benefit from modifiers like +1 to Level of all # (e.g. Fire/Minion) Skill Gems, as support gems are not skill gems..[2] This includes hybrid gems with both support and skill components, such as Impending Doom SupportImpending Doom SupportSupport, Hex, Spell, AoE, Chaos, TriggerIcon: XLevel: (1-20)Cost & Reservation Multiplier: 130%Cooldown Time: 0.15 secCan Store 3 Use(s)Cast Time: 1.00 secCritical Strike Chance: 5.00%Requires Level 31Supports hex curse skills, causing them to trigger Doom Blast when the hex ends.

Awakened support gems and their non-awakened counterparts are considered the same gem. If a skill gem is simultaneously supported by an awakened support and its non-awakened counterpart, only the awakened support gem's effects will apply, if possible. The keyword "Exceptional Support Gems" refer to the following drop-only gems[3]: These gems are rare drops and cannot be purchased from a vendor. The keyword "Awakened Exceptional Support Gems" refer to the following gems[4]: These are currently only obtained from the Maven on Uber difficulty. Some unique item causes skill gems socketed to the item to be supported by a support skill not available from support gems.
