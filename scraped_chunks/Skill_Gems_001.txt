Skill Gems are a type of Gem in Path of Exile 2 (PoE 2). Skill Gems are the primary means by which you gain active abilities in the game. When you equip a Skill Gem, it grants you a specific Skill that you can use during combat. These skills can range from offensive abilities to defensive or utility skills. The skills provided by these Gems can be leveled up over time, increasing their effectiveness, such as enhancing their damage output, expanding their area of effect, or improving other aspects of the skill. Note: For a full table comparison of skills, see Skills In Path of Exile 2, Skill Gems are no longer attached to gear but are instead directly equipped by your character, with up to 9 active skills able to be used at once. Each Skill Gem can be enhanced by up to 5 Support Gems, which modify the skill's effects and behavior, allowing for a high degree of customization. To equip a Skill Gem, simply slot it into the leftmost section of the Skill Window. Once equipped, the skill will become available for use in your Skill Bar, located next to your Mana Orb at the bottom-right corner of the screen. From there, you can assign the skill to any slot by opening a pop-up menu, where you can choose from your currently equipped skills. Although all Skill Gems are accessible to all classes, certain skills are associated with specific weapon types, meaning that some abilities require particular equipment to use effectively. In Path of Exile 2, you can acquire Uncut Skill Gems and Uncut Support Gems, which drop as you defeat monsters and scale with the level of the area where they are obtained. These Gems provide greater flexibility, allowing you to choose the Skills you want as you progress through the game. Each Skill has specific level and attribute requirements that must be met before you can Engrave them into your character's setup. Some Skills also have a minimum level requirement. In Path of Exile 2, you can level up your Skills using Uncut Gems. These Gems drop with varying levels, meaning you could find a Level 5 Uncut Gem early in the campaign or a Level 19 Uncut Gem as you approach the endgame. If you don't need an Uncut Gem to Engrave a new Skill, you can use it to upgrade one of your existing Skills instead. In Path of Exile 2, Support Gems allow you to modify and enhance the behavior of your active Skill Gems, providing a way to tailor your abilities to suit your playstyle. When you find a Support Gem, right-clicking it opens a menu with a variety of recommended options that work well with your active Skill Gems. If a suggested Support Gem seems like a good fit, it’s likely to synergize well, but feel free to experiment and find what works best for you. You can also uncheck the "recommended" option to view a full list of Support Gems that can be paired with your active skills, offering even more possibilities for customization. Keep in mind that you can only equip one of each Support Gem, so choose wisely to maximize the effectiveness of your skills. Each active Skill Gem can have up to 5 Support Gems socketed into it, starting with 2 Sockets. You can increase this limit up to five using Jeweller's Orbs, which can be found throughout the game. These Support Gems can significantly alter how your Skills function, allowing you to create a build that’s uniquely suited to your playstyle. I was getting these to drop like crazy but now I haven’t seen one in like 6 map clears. I’m halfway through Act 2. Did I miss something? I keep getting support gems which I don’t want lol 0 0 No you can't, the number of socket for weapon (martial or magic) increases by itself depending on player level (i don't know exactly when but i would say first increase around lvl 45 to 50) 0 0 Can you get and lvl up all active skill gems for a wepon? 6 24 Can you get and lvl up all active skill gems for a wepon? 3 16 Can you get and lvl up all active skill gems for a wepon? 2 20
