Explosive Arrow is a bow attack skill that fires an arrow which sticks to terrain or enemies and explodes after a duration, dealing damage in an area. Any additional arrows stuck to an enemy will add their damage to the explosion, while also granting more damage with hits, damaging ailments, and area of effect. Explosive Arrow has two separate damaging mechanics: arrow collisions and exploding arrows.[1] Collision: Attacking fires a regular arrow, colliding with enemies and dealing damage with no special mechanics. Instead of disappearing, arrows remain stuck to terrain or enemies for a duration. Sticking additional arrows in an enemy does not affect the duration of other arrows. Explosion: When the duration of an arrow expires, the maximum number of stuck arrows is reached, or a target dies, all arrows on a target will explode for area projectile damage. Each arrow calculates its own damage, individually, including critical strike chance and chance to inflict damaging ailments. Hit damage and ailment dps from each arrow are then combined and applied as a single hit and debuff.[2] If any contributing arrow deals a critical strike, the combined hit counts as a critical strike for relevant effects, though without further modifying damage.[3] The Explosion deals 50% less Base Damage stat only modifies base damage, meaning flat damage contributed by local values on your bow.[4] Projectile Mechanics: Arrows cannot stick in enemies if they continue due to Chain, Pierce, Fork, Split or Return.

Each arrow will calculate the damage it contributes independently, but for the purpose of on-hit effects, the explosion hit is dealt by the entity that fired the arrow responsible for causing the explosion.
