Close Combat Support is a support gem which grants the supported attack more melee damage based on how close the user is to the enemy. It also causes the skill to grant Combat Rush on hit, a buff which grants the next travel skill used within 2 seconds more attack speed. This support gem restricts the skill to swords and axes. The "up to x% more damage" stat on Close Combat support (and the matching stat on the Slayer's Impact notable) applies the full damage bonus to targets up to a distance of 1.5 metres from you, then linearly scales down the bonus to 0 at a distance of 4 metres.[1] Close Combat appears to be a buff, scaling with IchimonjiIchimonjiCorsair SwordOne Handed SwordPhysical Damage: (45-58.5) to (167.4-195)Critical Strike Chance: 5.00%Attacks per Second: (1.86-1.94)Weapon Range: 1.1 metresRequires Level 58, 81 Str, 117 Dex40% increased Global Accuracy Rating(80-95)% increased Physical DamageAdds (5-10) to (13-20) Physical Damage(20-25)% increased Attack Speed10% increased Effect of Buffs on you10% increased Mana Reservation Efficiency of SkillsAllies' Aura Buffs do not affect youYour Aura Buffs do not affect alliesMaster yourself before you seek to master others., but lacks the typical green-bordered icon.
