Projectiles: By default, Forbidden Rite fires a projectile near your cursor, as well as additional projectiles for each enemy within range. This means that on single target, two projectiles will hit the enemy. Sources of additional projectiles will only add projectiles to the initial cursor-targeted projectile, and not the extra projectiles fired towards nearby enemies. The projectiles appear to have an expanding ring-based hit distribution, and it is recommended not to get more than +4 additional projectiles from various sources due to the tendency for projectiles to miss on smaller single targets. The projectiles appear to have a homing behaviour and will bend towards targeted enemies. The projectile is ground targeted and does not benefit from Chain, Fork, Split, Pierce or any projectile behaviour modifiers. However, Projectile Speed will greatly reduce the time between casting the skill and the impact of the projectile, enhancing the skill performance against moving enemies. Totems: The totem playstyle has several mechanics that bypass or mitigate the downsides while being able to efficiently scale the spell.
