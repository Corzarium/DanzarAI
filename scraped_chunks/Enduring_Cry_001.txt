You are Regenerating Life Enduring Cry is a warcry skill that taunts enemies in an area around the character, and grants the user and allies a life regeneration buff and a number of endurance charges, both based on the power of nearby enemies. Unlike most warcry skills, Enduring Cry does not exert your attacks. Power: Normal Monsters have 1 Power, Magic Monsters 2, Rare Monsters 10, Unique Monsters 20, and Players 5 Duration: Skill Effect Duration, Buff Duration, and Warcry Duration will only affect the duration of the regeneration buff, not the taunt or endurance charges. Warcry Speed: Warcry Speed will accelerate the animation of enduring cry. Cast Speed and Attack Speed have no effect on warcry skills, as warcry skills are neither attacks nor spells.
