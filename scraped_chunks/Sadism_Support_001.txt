Sadism Support is a support gem which causes damaging ailments you inflict to deal damage faster and have less duration. Sadism Support greatly modifies ailment duration. Damaging Ailments inflicted with Supported Skills deal damage #% faster is additive with other modifiers that cause ailments to deal damage faster or slower. To calculate the new ailment duration after supporting it with Sadism Support, use the following formula: Without any other sources of increased ailment duration, damaging ailments have the following modified base durations: Ignite and Bleeding gain more value from Sadism Support, as they cannot normally stack (and when they do, have a maximum stack amount), causing excessive stacks to be wasted. Modifying its duration to be significantly shorter allows greater efficiency of ailments. However, Sadism will also more likely than not result in large dps losses due to several factors, such as the fact "Damaging Ailments inflicted with Supported Skills deal damage faster" is additive to other sources (making it a poor support to begin with) and the fact it will very likely result in uptime losses, as you will need to continuously use your skills in order to inflict several bleeds or ignite per second. As soon as you are not able to do so, the slight dps increase is immediately lost by the fact you are not doing any damage while moving. Poison does not inherently have this issue as there is no maximum limit to poison stacks. However, several mechanics may benefit from having short-duration poisons so they expire before the next application, such as the Poison Mastery and stacking Low Tolerance which care about non-poisoned enemies, and Viper Strike of the MambaViper Strike of the MambaAttack, Duration, Melee, Strike, ChaosLevel: (1-20)Cost: (6-10) ManaAttack Damage: (155-442)% of baseEffectiveness of Added Damage: (155-442)%Hits enemies, converting some of your physical damage to chaos damage and inflicting poison which will be affected by modifiers to skill duration.
