Brand Recall is a spell that recalls all brands to the caster and causes them to activate. Brand Recall can only reach level 6 through regular experience gain, but the required experience to reach level 6 is comparable to that of regular gems. Its level cap can be exceeded the same way as other gems. Activations caused by Brand Recall cannot benefit from against Branded Enemy stats, even if the brand immediately attaches to an enemy. Spends 20% of Brand's Cost is a cost for effects that interact with costs, like Eldritch Battery or Tawhanuku's TimingTawhanuku's TimingMoonstone RingRequires Level 44+(15-25) to maximum Energy Shield(30-40)% increased Spell Damage+(60-80) to maximum Mana(5-10)% chance to Freeze, Shock and IgniteSpells cause you to gain Energy Shield equal to their UpfrontCost every fifth time you Pay itThe soul still beats, even when the heart never did. or stats that count total resource spent. It is not directly affected by cost modifiers (as the modifiers would already apply to the brand's cost, to prevent double-dipping). If the cost of the recalled brands changes, the cost spent by Brand Recall updates to match it. Insufficient mana or life does not prevent the brands from being recalled.
