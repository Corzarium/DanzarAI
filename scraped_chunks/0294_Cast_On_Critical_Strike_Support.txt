Cast on Critical Strike (commonly referred to as CoC) is a support gem that causes linked spells to trigger when the player critically strikes with a linked attack skill. If more than one spell is supported by Cast on Critical Support, the order of the triggered spells will follow the trigger order. (Successive triggers cycle through all valid supported spells in the same order.) Each supported skill has its own cooldown, except multiple copies of the same spell, which share their cooldown. Due to how server frames are calculated, there are breakpoints of cooldown recovery rates required to achieve a higher effective trigger rate.[1]. Additional cooldown reduction that does not reach the next threshold is wasted. The attack rates below are maximums; exceeding the attack rates even slightly can significantly reduce proc rate due to skipping procs while the skill is still on cooldown. It is better to be slightly below the attack rate than above it. Note that multiples of the attack rate also work (e.g. 12.12 APS will proc at the same rate as 6.06 APS). Cast On Critical Strike Support can drop anywhere.
