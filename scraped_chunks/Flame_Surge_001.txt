Flame Surge is a spell that deals fire damage in a narrow area of effect in front of the caster. It deals more damage against burning enemies. The skill itself cannot inflict ignite, but hitting an ignited enemy with Flame Surge leaves behind burning ground that deals damage proportional to the ignite damage. Area of Effect: Flame Surge fires a wave of flame in a very narrow cone, increasing the area of effect radius will increase the effective range of the skill. Damage Bonus: All sources of burning enable the damage bonus.
