Explosive Trap is a spell that throws a trap that creates multiple explosions when triggered. It deals physical damage that's converted to fire damage. The base radius of the large explosion is 1.2m, and the base radius of the small explosions is 0.7m, with the default size having a radius of 1.0m. Both of these radii are increased by the +x metres to radius gained from gem levels and by modifiers to Area of Effect. The chance that a small explosion will hit a targeted enemy can be calculated as ( r s m a l l + r e n e m y âˆ’ 0.1 m ) 2 / ( r l a r g e ) 2 \color [rgb]{0.6392156862745098,0.5529411764705883,0.42745098039215684}(r_{small}+r_{enemy}-0.1m)^{2}/(r_{large})^{2} . Increases to radius improve the overlap chance of small explosions on the targeted enemy by increasing the ratio of the small radius to the large radius, while increased area of effect may either increase or decrease the overlap chance, as different breakpoints in the calculation of the large and small radius are reached.[1] Explosive Trap can drop anywhere.
