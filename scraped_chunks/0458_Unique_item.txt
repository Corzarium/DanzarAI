A unique item is an item with a specific name, unique artwork, and a predetermined list of modifiers. Unique items usually have the same implicit modifier as a normal item of the same type. Unique items are meant to be less powerful overall than high-level rare items, but offer unique gameplay and allow special character builds to be based around them.[citation needed] Currently there are 1,183 released unique items, including maps and items with modifier variants. For a timeline when each unique item was added, see the timeline of unique items. The following is a non-exhaustive list of ways that unique items can be obtained. Unique items can always be traded. Like all items, unique items can have legacy variants. This means for some uniques there exist better (or worse) versions that aren't dropping anymore in Standard leagues. The main source of legacy items are nerfs that affect future item drops, but leave the already existing items as they were. The only way to get these legacy items is from players who had them before they were changed.
