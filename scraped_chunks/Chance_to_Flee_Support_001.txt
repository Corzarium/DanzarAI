Chance to Flee Support is a support gem that grants supported skills a chance to cause monsters to flee when they are hit by those skills. Enemies hit by the supported skill will have a Chance to Flee; they will attempt to run to a random point somewhere away from the character until they reach a certain point, are interrupted, or are unable to reach their selected point and give up. If a fleeing enemy becomes stunned, their fleeing behaviour will be interrupted. Magic monsters have a 50% chance to avoid fleeing for any reason, and rare monsters are immune to this gem's effects. Some monsters naturally flee when they are burning. This includes apes, humanoids and sea witches. This support gem has limited usage, as groups of normal and magic monsters are usually not dangerous enough to threaten a character. Causing a monster to flee often increases the amount of effort required to kill them, as packs can scatter in different directions lowering the efficiency of attacks and spells that target an area. The gem may benefit characters using the far Shot keyword, or characters who cause bleeding and want to ensure weak targets still take the increased damage rate caused by movement. Characters using bows and seeking increased bleeding damage might be better served by the Ensnaring Arrow skill gem. Chance to Flee Support can drop anywhere.
