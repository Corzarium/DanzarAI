Blade Flurry is a channeling melee attack. While channeling, Blade Flurry repeatedly attacks a random enemy in front of the player, also damaging enemies nearby the original target. When released, it will unleash an extra number of attacks equal to the stage reached. BF produces highest dps when player channels to max stages and then releases immediately. Calculations are for the perfect channeling, actual damage will be a bit lower. Calculating ideal dps: For 21 lvl gem : For 21 lvl gem with +1 max stage enchant: Current assumption is that strike calculates damage before updating stage bonus. So fist strike has 0 stage bonus, and n strike has n-1 stage bonus up to max. Release strikes happen after stage bonus has been updated, so they fully benefit from current stage bonus. It is corroborated by Zrevnur's DPS test in the VERY OLD patch.
