Iron Grip is a support gem that grants the supported skill the effects of the Iron Grip keystone, as well as increased projectile damage. This gem causes strength's physical damage bonus to also apply to projectile attacks made with the supported skills. This causes the supported skill to gain 1% increased physical projectile attack per 5 strength. Since this gem applies the same effect as the Iron Grip keystone passive, these effects do not stack. Taking the keystone in addition to using this gem will impart no additional benefits. Iron Grip Support can drop anywhere.
