Bladestorm is a melee attack skill that creates a bladestorm that continuously deals damage in an area for a short duration. Its properties change depending on whether the user is in Blood Stance or Sand Stance. Bladestorm has two components: an initial melee attack that deals damage around the player, and a lingering blood or stand storm that will repeatedly (based on attack speed) deal 50% of melee damage to enemies within its area. This skill interacts with Blood and Sand Stance: In either stance, Bladestorm will have more attack speed while inside a blood bladestorm. While the storms have 100% chance to inflict blind or bleeding, the initial hit does not.[1] The storms generated by the initial melee attack will wait for the duration of the attack time to start dealing damage, e.g. if you have an attack time of 0.5 seconds, the storm will start dealing damage after 0.5 seconds. Because hits do not snapshot, existing storms will account for any changes to the skill's stats, including attack rate.[2] When used with General's CryGeneral's CryWarcry, AoE, DurationLevel: (1-20)Cost: (15-19) ManaCooldown Time: 3.00 secCan Store 1 Use(s)Use Time: 0.80 secAoE Radius: 60Requires Level 24Performs a warcry, taunting nearby enemies to attack the user, and summoning Mirage Warriors from nearby corpses.
