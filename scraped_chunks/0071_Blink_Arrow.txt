Blink Arrow is an attack that fires an arrow, upon reaching the destination you are teleported there and a clone is summoned at your previous location. The clone is a minion that uses your bow and quiver. The skill happens in four stages: The length of the first stage is affected by anything that affects regular attacks - weapon base speed, attack speed modifiers etc. The length of the second stage is affected both by bonuses to projectile speed and by global bonuses to attack speed, but not by the weapon's base speed[2][3]. The delay is unaffected by distance travelled. The delay of the first two stages can be reduced by linking Faster Attacks SupportFaster Attacks SupportAttack, SupportIcon: ALevel: (1-20)Cost & Reservation Multiplier: 110%Requires Level 8Supports attack skills.Supported Skills have (20-44)% increased Attack Speed Additional Effects From 1-20% Quality: Supported Skills have (0.5-10)% increased Attack SpeedThis is a Support Gem.
