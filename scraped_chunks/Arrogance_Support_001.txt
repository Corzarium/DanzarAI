Arrogance Support is a support gem. It grants the supported skills increased aura effect and causes them to reserve life instead of mana, similar to the Blood Magic keystone, but at the expense of a very high reservation multiplier ((220%-201%) for level 1-20 gems). This gem is typically used on Low life builds that also have a high energy shield as the effective life (ehp) pool.
