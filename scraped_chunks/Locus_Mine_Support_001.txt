Locus Mine Support is a support gem that modifies the supported bow or wand attack skill so that instead of casting it directly, the player throws a mine which uses the skill when the player detonates them. Mines are thrown in an arc shape, and fire projectiles toward the player.

Modifiers that cause additional projectiles to be fired will only apply to the initial arrows, and the spore pods will be divided between those arrows.Arrows Pierce all Targets60% of Physical Damage Converted to Chaos Damage150% more Damage with Hits and Ailments per StageMaximum 5 StagesLeaves 1 Spore Pod per StageEach Spore Pod fires 9 Thorn ArrowsThorn Arrows deal 50% less Damage Additional Effects From 1-20% Quality: Each Spore Pod fires +(0.1-2) Thorn ArrowsPlace into an item socket of the right colour to gain this skill.
