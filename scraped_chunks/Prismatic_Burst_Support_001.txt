Prismatic Burst Support is a support gem that causes the supported attack skill to release a Prismatic Burst on hit, dealing spell damage of a random chosen element in an area around the enemy. The player's strength, dexterity, and intelligence values determine the likelihood to pick fire, cold, and lightning damage respectively. Restrictions: Supports attacks, causing them to trigger the Prismatic Burst spell. Cannot support triggered attacks or attacks used by things other than you. Cannot modify the skills of minions. Prismatic Burst triggers at the location where the enemy was hit by an attack. Choosing elements: The % chance for Prismatic Burst to choose each specific element is visible in the tooltip for the skill. Conversion: Due to the Deals 100% less Damage of each unchosen Damage Type modifier, converting the skill's damage (such as with Avatar of Fire) will prevent unchosen damage types from adding any damage to the chosen damage type. Additionally, Prismatic Burst will be unable to ignite unless the chosen damage type of the hit is Fire. Additionally, Prismatic Burst cannot deal any Physical or Chaos damage, so modifiers that cause you to gain Elemental or non-Chaos Damage as Chaos Damage have no effect; this skill cannot poison enemies. Prismatic Burst Support can drop anywhere.
