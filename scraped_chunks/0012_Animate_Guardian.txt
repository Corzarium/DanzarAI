It is possible to prevent a body armour worn by a Guardian from being deleted upon Guardian death by crafting the Item drops on Death if Equipped by an Animated Guardian mod onto it; this will only cause that specific item to drop. It does not protect other equipped items. Note that equipment is not lost if the Animate Guardian is despawned, such as by removing the gem from a socket. Necromantic Aegis: While using Necromantic Aegis your Guardian benefits from its own shield as well as the one you have equipped, allowing it to gain the benefit of two shields at once. Some unique shields can be quite powerful when doubled up this way.[1] Player versus Player: Animated Guardians killed in PvP areas will not lose their items.

In fact, not only is it possible to lose the Guardian's items here, but death is very likely because of the way PvP damage scaling works.

Life regeneration and percentage increases to life are especially potent on an Animated Guardian because of its huge innate life pool. Resistances should also be capped to improve survivability (a Guardian has 40% base elemental resistances and 20% chaos resistance). The stats displayed in the skill's tooltip only accounts for modifiers the skill has, like from the passive tree, jewels, player-equipped items and support gems.
