Lifetap Support is a support gem that causes linked skills to have a life cost instead of a mana cost, similar to the Blood Magic keystone, at the expense of a high cost multiplier. Spending a certain amount of life grants the Lifetap buff, which allows skills supported by Lifetap to deal more damage.
