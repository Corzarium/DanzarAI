Power Charge On Critical Support is a support gem that gives supported skills a chance of granting the player a power charge when they deal a critical strike, as well as more damage per power charge. Although each critical strike has an independent chance to grant a charge, most skills are limited to gaining 1 charge per attack or cast, including repeats.[1] Some skills bypass this limitation, see charge gain.
