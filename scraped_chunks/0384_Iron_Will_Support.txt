Iron Will is a support gem that causes the supported skill to gain the effects of the Iron Will keystone, as well as increased spell damage. This gem causes strength's physical damage bonus to also apply to spell damage dealt with the supported skills. This causes the supported skill to gain 1% increased spell damage per 5 strength. Note that this applies to all spell damage, not just physical. Since this gem applies the same effect as the Iron Will keystone passive, these effects do not stack. Taking the keystone in addition to using this gem will impart no additional benefits. Iron Will Support can drop anywhere. Iron Will Support can be created from the following recipes: This item can be bought at the listed NPC vendors, after completing the following quests:
