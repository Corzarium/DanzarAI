Spell Echo is a support gem that causes supported spells to repeat. A repeat is part of the original cast. It does not require a cost or a cooldown, normally has the same critical strike roll, and does not cause when you cast effects to occur a second time.[1] Spell Echo can only modify non-instant spells cast by a player or minion. It cannot support skills used by proxies or spells that trigger.[2] Repeats are not reflected in most ingame tooltip information: the time required for both the original cast and the repeat is two times the tooltip value.
