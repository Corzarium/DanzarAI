Replica unique items or replicas are engineered reproductions of existing unique items. They resemble the originals in design, but they come with a particular twist that makes them functionally different. Replicas can be obtained in the Curio Display in the final reward rooms of any Grand Heists. In almost all cases Replicas share the same base type as the original item.

However, the modifiers on the items may differ significantly. All Replicas have names starting with Replica and symbol in front and at the back of their names. Although these symbols are not mutually exclusive with influenced items (which also have symbols), Replicas that do not have influence(s) by default cannot be obtained with influence.

In-game this is explained by the item being a Replica of an item that does not exist, making it the actual genuine item.
