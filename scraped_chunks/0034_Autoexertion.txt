Autoexertion is a skill gem that reserves mana for each supported warcry skill to have them trigger automatically once off cooldown. Supported warcries no longer grant buffs or charges, but can still exert attacks and debuff enemies. When linked to Autoexertion, all supported warcries each have a base reservation of 15%. This can be modified by modifiers to reservation efficiency. These modified reservations are then added together, and the sum is used as a single reservation for Autoexertion. This value cannot be further modified, as reservation efficiency is already applied. Autoexertion does not cause warcries to share a cooldown; each warcry will automatically trigger at the end of their cooldowns. Triggering a warcry does not count as 'using' a warcry for when you use a Warcry, but it does count as warcrying for when you Warcry effects (e.g. Lead By Example, gain 5 Valour when you Warcry, if able Banner Mastery), and also as having Warcried Recently (e.g. Admonisher or DeidbellowDeidbellowGilded SalletArmour: (290-397)Evasion: (90-97)Requires Level 33, 38 Str, 38 Dex+(20-30) to Strength+(20-30) to DexterityAdds 10 to 20 Physical Damage to Attacks+(200-300) to Armour20% increased Melee DamageCannot Leech when on Low LifeIf you've Warcried Recently, you and nearby allies have 20% increased Attack, Cast and Movement SpeedMay it echo through the halls.).[1] When warcries are triggered through Autoexertion, each warcry's base mana cost is overwritten to 10 instead of the value on the warcry gem.
