Cruelty Support is a support gem. Hits from active skills supported by this gem grant the Cruelty buff. Per its reminder text, Cruelty makes all Skills Supported by Cruelty Support deal up to 40% more Damage over Time, based on the amount of Damage in the Hit which grants it. The buff affects all skills supported by any Cruelty Support. Damaging ailments inflicted by a hit that grants Cruelty are not affected by that instance of Cruelty, because damage calculation occurs before on-hit buffs are gained. Proxies cannot gain or grant the player Cruelty. Damage over time from a proxy's skill can benefit from Cruelty Support if the player obtains a Cruelty buff from a different skill that deals damage directly.[1] (This is likely not an option for totems due to Ancestral Bond.) Minion skills that also deal damage directly (e.g. Dominating BlowDominating BlowAttack, Minion, Duration, Melee, StrikeLevel: (1-20)Cost: (7-10) ManaAttack Damage: (249-458)% of baseEffectiveness of Added Damage: (249-458)%Requires Level 28Attacks enemies with a melee strike, applying a debuff for a short duration.
