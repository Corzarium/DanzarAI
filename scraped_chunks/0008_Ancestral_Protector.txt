This article describes historical game content. In Version 3.25.0, melee totems have been removed from the game. Ancestral Protector is a totem skill that creates an Ancestor Totem which will attack enemies with melee strikes while the player stands close to it. Being near it increases the player's attack speed. Ancestral Protector is drop disabled. Resistances: The following helmet enchantments affect Ancestral Protector. Note that helmet enchantments are no longer obtainable since version 3.23.0 and can only be obtained in permanent leagues as already enchanted items from before this patch.
