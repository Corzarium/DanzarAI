Culling Strike is a support gem. If an enemy is left with 10% life or less after getting hit by a skill supported by Culling Strike, they will be instantly slain. Culling strike affects enemies regardless of their rarity, but does not work on enemies that have a scripted death, such as Uber Elder in its final phase,[1] beasts captured by Einhar, or Catarina, Master of Undeath.
