Arcane Cloak is a guard skill that consumes a large amount of mana to apply a buff that absorbs incoming damage for a short period of time. The buff absorbs more damage and grants added lightning damage the more mana was spent. Guard skill: Guard skills share cooldown with other guard skills. They do not go on cooldown until the buff they provide expires. Mana spent: The mana consumed by Arcane Cloak is considered spent mana, which means it can interact with effects based on mana spent, such as Arcane Surge SupportArcane Surge SupportArcane, Support, Spell, DurationIcon: NLevel: (1-20)Cost & Reservation Multiplier: 130%Each supported spell will track how much mana you spend on it, granting a buff when the total mana spent reaches a threshold.
