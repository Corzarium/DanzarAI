This article describes historical game content. Originally part of the prophecy system, fated unique items were improved versions of other unique items. Various unique items could be upgraded to their fated forms by fulfilling the prophecy that involved slaying a specific unique monster while holding that item. Once the prophecy was fulfilled, the item would be given a new name and additional stats. Fated unique items started to be phased out in version 3.17.0 and were fully removed in version 3.19.0. Fated unique items were originally part of the prophecy system, first introduced in Prophecy league. A number of prophecies could be fulfilled by defeating a specific unique monster while holding a specific unique item. As a result of fulfilling the prophecy, the unique item would be transformed into its fated form, giving it additional stats, a new name and new flavor text.

The first iteration of the upgrade process required the character to have the unique item equipped as the monster was killed in order to fulfill the prophecy. In version 3.1.0, this restriction was loosened; the player could either equip the item or simply place it in the character's inventory while defeating the monster. In all cases, the prophecy would remain unfulfilled if the unique item was corrupted, or it was an alternate art or foil variant. When a unique item was upgraded into its fated form, its name and flavor text would change, and it would gain (and sometimes lose) one or more modifiers, depending on the item. Apart from that, it would retain all of its original properties. Its appearance, quality value, item level, and base stats would stay the same. The number, color and link configuration of its sockets would remain unchanged, along with any gems placed into those sockets. Any modifiers that carried over to the fated version would keep the same values that they had originally.

Before the removal of the prophecy system in version 3.17.0, the following prophecies could be fulfilled to transform a certain unique item into its fated form. Prophecies no longer exist in the game. With the removal of the prophecy system in version 3.17.0, Grinding Gear Games began to phase out fated unique items. Over half of them became unobtainable outside of trading with other players in permanent leagues. At the same time, some unique items were reworked to be equivalent or similar to their old fated forms. The fated unique items that remained during the phasing out period formed a special pool of drop-restricted unique items. Map bosses were given a small chance to drop a random fated unique item, already identified, in addition to their other loot drops. During this time, random fated unique items could also be acquired by turning in sets of Akil's ProphecyAkil's Prophecy3Elegant Round ShieldTwo-ImplicitCorruptedThe hatungo know many answers to the same question, for time itself is a tangled web. and The TransformationThe Transformation5Tainted Mythic OrbEven the most beautiful of transformations can still have a dark side..
