Block Chance Reduction is a support gem. It reduces the target's chance to block attack or spell damage from the supported skills. If the enemy blocks the supported skill, it inflicts overpowered which further reduces the enemies' chance to block. It is a recipe-only support gem intended to have a player-versus-player focus. Skills supported by this gem apply a stacking debuff called Overpowered. Some bosses in the game have mods that increase their block chance, such as Thena Moga, the Crimson Storm of Courthouse MapCourthouse MapMap Level: 79Map Tier: 12Guild Character: fJustice born of love is a surrender.Justice born of law is a punishment.Travel to this Map by using it in a personal Map Device.
