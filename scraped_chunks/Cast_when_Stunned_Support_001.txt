Cast when Stunned is a support gem that grants supported spells a chance to trigger when the player is stunned or blocks a stunning hit. Different spells supported by Cast when Stunned are independent: when the character is stunned or blocks a stunning hit, each supported spell rolls its own chance to trigger, and each spell that succeeds its chance check will trigger and go on its own cooldown. Because multiple copies of the same spell (or a transfigured variant) with the same trigger share a cooldown, supporting duplicate spells with Cast when Stunned will only result in two chance rolls, never two triggers. Triggered spells will target the location of the enemy that stunned the player.
