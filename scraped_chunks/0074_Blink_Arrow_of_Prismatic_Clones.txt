The Elemental Hit used by the clones does not cause an area of effect when hitting enemies affected by ailments, and only has 20% chance to cause Ignite, Freeze, and Shock.

Damage other than the chosen element cannot be dealt, meaning the minions' arrows can never deal chaos damage or Poison.[1] The skill does not choose the same element twice in a row unless choices are limited by Combat Focus jewels.[2] Blink Arrow of Prismatic Clones has restrictions on where or how it can drop.
