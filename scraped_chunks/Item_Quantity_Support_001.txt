Item Quantity is a support gem. It increases the quantity of items dropped by monsters killed by the supported skill. This skill gem no longer drops in the game, and can only be obtained by trading for existing ones in the permanent leagues.[1] However, it can be found as a foil in the Legacy league through Reliquary Key.[citation needed] See also: Item Rarity SupportItem Rarity SupportSupportIcon: RLevel: (1-20)Requires Level 31Supports any skill that can kill enemies.(40-59)% increased Rarity of Items Dropped by Enemies Slain from Supported Skills Additional Effects From 1-20% Quality: (0.5-10)% increased Rarity of Items Dropped by Enemies Slain from Supported SkillsThis is a Support Gem. It does not grant a bonus to your character, but to skills in sockets connected to it. Place into an item socket connected to a socket containing the Skill Gem you wish to augment. Right click to remove from a socket. Damage over time: Increased item quantity from this gem applies also to enemies killed by damage over time effects.[2] Containers: The modifier from this gem does not apply to the quantity of items dropped by opening chests, strongboxes, or other containers. Mechanics that have a defined drop count are also unaffected. For example, the number of abyss jewel drops from Abyssal Troves, essences from imprisoned monster, Blight reward chests, etc, are not affected. Boss drop: While this will affect the quantity of items drops from a map boss, it will not affect the boss specific drop quantity. Fragments from guardians and conquerors, boss specific uniques and boss specific currencies are not affected by item quantity. Maps: This gem does not affect the number of maps that drop. When linked with a skill that creates a minion, trap, mine, or totem, the item quantity modifier will apply to kills made by the minion/trap/mine/totem. This includes deaths caused by Minion Instability explosions. Item Quantity Support is drop disabled.
