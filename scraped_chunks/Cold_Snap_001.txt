Cold Snap is a spell that deals cold damage to enemies in an area, leaving chilled ground that expands and deals cold damage over time. It has a cooldown that can be bypassed with Frenzy Charges. It also has a 25% chance to grant a frenzy charge when you kill an enemy within its area of effect. Modifiers to Spell Damage apply to this Skill's Damage Over Time effect: this modifier allows spell damage modifiers to modify the skill's natural cold damage over time. It will not apply to other types of damage over time, such as Ignite. Chilled Ground: Cold Snap creates an expanding chilled ground that causes enemies to be chilled. While its base effect will scale with the player or skill's modifiers to cold and non-damaging ailments, it is not considered a chill inflicted by the player, limiting the use of certain stats. (See chilling area.) Trigger: Even if the appropriate charges are available, Cold Snap's cooldown cannot be bypassed when triggered.[1] Cold Snap can drop anywhere.
