Destructive Link is a Link skill that targets an allied player to apply a buff which links you to them for a duration. While linked, they use your critical strike chance for main hand hits. If the target dies while linked, you will also die. This skill cannot be used by Totems, Traps, or Mines. This skill replaces the linked target's main hand critical strike chance with yours; this uses the value in the player's character sheet which is affected by modifiers to critical strike chance, not just the base critical strike chance of the weapon.
