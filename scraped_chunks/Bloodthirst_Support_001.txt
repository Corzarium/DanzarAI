Bloodthirst Support is a support gem that grants more damage to attacks made with the supported skill. It also grants added flat physical damage with weapons based on your maximum life pool to the skill while on low life. Bloodthirst's more damage modifier is active unconditionally, whether the character is on low life or not. The flat added physical damage is a conditional modifier, because it is only active while on low life and using a weapon. Damage Calculations The total damage depends on the characters maximum life and total flat damage from other sources. These calculations count both the flat physical damage and the more damage. Therefore they assume the character is on low life and using a weapon. Add up all flat sources of damage not from the gem = Q (Total life X .02) = Y ( Q + Y ) = K ( K X More damage) = V (V / Q) = final answer. Colours indicate scenarios where Level 20 Melee Physical Damage Support or Level 5 Awakened Melee Physical Damage Support would be more beneficial. Bloodthirst Support can drop anywhere.
