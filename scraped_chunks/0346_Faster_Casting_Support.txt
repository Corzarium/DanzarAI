Faster Casting is a support gem that increases the cast speed of linked spells. When linked to a minion skill, Faster Casting increases both the cast speed of the summoning spell, and the speed with which summoned minions cast their own spells. Faster Casting also affects the speed with which totems, traps or mines cast spells, but not the speed of placing totems or laying traps or mines. Trap and mine laying speed is instead affected by Trap and Mine Laying Speed, and totem placement speed by Totem Placement Speed. Faster Casting Support can drop anywhere.
