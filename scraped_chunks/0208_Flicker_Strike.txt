Flicker Strike is a melee attack skill that teleports the character to a nearby enemy and strikes it with their weapon and grants increased movement speed for a short time. If no specific monster is chosen, one is picked at random. The skill has a cooldown that can be bypassed by expending a Frenzy Charge and has a chance to generate a Frenzy Charge when used. The character is considered to be stationary while flickering for the purpose of receiving buffs such as the Inexorable notable passive skill, and that they have moved each time they flickered. For this reason the character never benefits from "while moving" buffs, and the timers for scaling stationary buffs are continuously reset.[1] Minimum Frenzy Charges cannot be consumed to bypass the cooldown. Dual Wielding while using Flicker Strike will cause the player to alternate weapons each attack. Flicker Strike can target an enemy within a distance of 4 meters by default. This is unaffected by modifiers to area of effect. Modifiers to Melee Strike Range have no special interaction with teleports: you will neither "land" farther from the target when you flicker, nor will you be able to initiate an attack from farther away. Flicker Strike can drop anywhere.
