This means hits from the first 2 uses (attacks 1-6) will be "normal blows" and all hits from the third Multistrike use (attacks 7-9) will be Ruthless Blows. This is granted, only if you do not have additional repeats from other sources, such as Awakened Multistrike SupportAwakened Multistrike SupportAttack, Melee, SupportIcon: 3Level: (1-5)Cost & Reservation Multiplier: 150%Requires Level 72Supports melee attack skills, making them repeat three times when used, targeting a random enemy each time.

Using this idea, a Ruthless Blow may actually trigger by skill use, rather than skill attack. This means you will have to use the attack skill three times to benefit from a Ruthless Blow. The Ruthless Blow counter still counts whether or not you hit with a skill. For example: if you miss the hits from the first 2 uses of your supported attack, then Ruthless Blow will activate on your next (3rd) use whether it is a hit or not. This extends to Attack Cancelling, if you cancel the animation of your attack before it finishes, the Ruthless Blow counter still counts this and will activate on your third usage of the attack, whether you cancel it or not. It is possible to reset the Ruthless Blow counter to 0 by losing the active skill it supports, for example by resocketing it, or re-equipping the item it's socketed in. (Resocketing Ruthless Support itself does not reset the counter.) Tracking Blows: Keeping track of Ruthless Blows allows for them to be ready to use before a fight begins.
