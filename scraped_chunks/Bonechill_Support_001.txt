Bonechill Support is a support gem that grants the supported skill more cold damage and increased chill effect. Chills from supported skills also cause enemies to take increased cold damage (from all sources) equal to the strongest chill affecting them. Bonechill Support adds the increase Cold Damage taken by Chill Effect stat to chill debuffs from supported skills, as well as to chilling areas created by them. This is a boolean property, and accordingly does not stack when enemies are both chilled by a skill and inside that skill's chilling area.[1] Chill Effect refers to the enemy's strongest #% reduced Action Speed from any chill. This does not need to be applied by the same chill debuff: one chill can apply Bonechill, and another chill can apply the strongest action speed reduction.[2] This means the player can choose to support a secondary skill with Bonechill (e.g. FrostblinkFrostblinkSpell, Movement, Duration, Cold, Travel, Blink, AoELevel: (1-20)Cost: (12-22) ManaCooldown Time: (3.00 sec-2.60 sec)Can Store 1 Use(s)Cast Time: InstantCritical Strike Chance: 5.00%Effectiveness of Added Damage: (180-250)%Requires Level 4Teleport to a location, damaging enemies and leaving Chilled ground in an area at both ends of the teleport.

Because Bonechill's increased cold damage taken is applied by chill and based on chill effect, it is normally capped to 30%, has no effect on enemies Unaffected by Chill,[3] and will affect the player when their chill is reflected (e.g. by Non-Damaging Ailments you inflict are reflected back to you).
