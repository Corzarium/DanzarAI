Many unique items can have several variants. These variants can be categorized into several categories, which also affect their generation and method of acquisition. Variants are distinctly different items from each other, so rerolling their modifier values with a Divine OrbDivine OrbStack Size: 20Randomises the values of the random modifiers on an itemRight click this item then left click a magic, rare or unique item to apply it. will never transform them into another variant. It is possible for an item to both have basetype variants and modifier variants. Basetype variants share the same name but have a different base item type. Doryani's Delusion, Precursor's Emblem, and Grand Spectrum are both basetype variants and modifier variants. Synthesised uniques and their fractured or regular (obtained via vendor recipe) versions are also considered basetype variants. Modifier variants generate with distinct combinations of modifiers and cannot change between or reroll into other variants. Lord of Steel and Impresence are distinct in having different art for each variant despite having the same basetype and name. They also have individual slots for each unique item art variant in the Unique Collection Tab; the regular Elder and Uber Uber Elder variants of each damage type variant of Impresence share the same slots, however. Pseudo-variants are sets of items which are distinct and different in name, but are typically treated as variants of the same item.
