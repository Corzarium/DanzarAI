Melee Splash Support is a support gem that can be linked with a melee strike skill gem to add a splash effect to the attack, dealing damage around each enemy struck by it. Melee Splash only supports strike skills and has no interaction with other types of skills like slam skills. It causes the skill to deal damage around the strike target in a greater area than strike skill's default splashing behaviour. The splash damage is considered area melee damage and is not considered as part of the strike itself. The splash is affected by modifiers to area of effect and area damage, but will not affect the strike's damage if it was not originally dealing area damage.[1] The area of effect created by Melee Splash has a base radius of 14 units.[2] Splash can apply on-hit effects; for example, a hit that would knockback the target would also knockback enemies hit by the splash damage. The less damage multiplier for surrounding targets only applies to the splash effect and not other mechanics that hit enemies such as BoneshatterBoneshatterAttack, Melee, Strike, AoE, Duration, PhysicalLevel: (1-20)Cost: (9-12) ManaAttack Speed: 85% of baseAttack Damage: (231-338)% of baseEffectiveness of Added Damage: (231-338)%Requires Level 28Attack enemies with a forceful melee strike that also hurts you.
