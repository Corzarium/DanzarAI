Eternal Blessing Support is a support gem that makes Aura Skills lose their reservations and become a Blessing Skill. You will only be able to benefit from one Blessing at a time and while under the effect of a Supported Skill, all Non-Blessing Skills which reserve mana are disabled. This support gem lets you use a single aura without reserving mana for it, but it disables reserving mana for any other skill. Therefore, most auras, herald skills, mine skills, and aspect skills cannot be used alongside an Eternal Blessing aura, unless they are modified to reserve life (e.g. via Arrogance SupportArrogance SupportAura, SupportIcon: BLevel: (1-20)Cost & Reservation Multiplier: (220-201)%Requires Level 31Supports any non-blessing skill with a reservation.Supported Skills have (10-19)% increased Aura effectSupported Skills Reserve Life instead of Mana Additional Effects From 1-20% Quality: Supported Skills have (0.25-5)% increased Aura effectThis is a Support Gem.
