Guardian's Blessing Support is a support gem that makes an aura skill lose its reservation and become a Blessing Skill. You will only be able to benefit from one Blessing at a time. The aura can only be used while you have a supported minion, which takes a percentage of their maximum life as physical damage over time. Blessing: Blessing skills are limited to 1 aura at a time and cannot be used with other blessing skills. The blessing must be activated by casting it while the linked minion is alive. The aura is cast on the character, like other auras. If the minion dies or expires, Guardian's Blessing is turned off and must be re-activated.

Blessed Rebirth can be used to guarantee a minimum uptime of the Guardian's Blessing while the minion cannot be damaged. Minions: Cannot support minions which are invulnerable (e.g. Raise Spiders). A tanky minion is required, as the blessing aura is turned off when the minion dies or expires.
