This list is retained even upon exiting the area, removing the Raise Spectre gem, after your Spectres die or are unsummoned, or logging out. There is currently no way to clear a spectre bank; it can only be ignored by removing the Raise Spectre gem. Spectral Corpses will only be created if at least one monster is in your spectre bank. Before 10 or more different monsters are saved in the spectre bank, each additional spectre saved dilutes the chance for the Spectral Corpse to be a specific spectre. After 10 or more spectres are saved, the chance does not get further diluted, and the oldest monster saved will be removed from the spectre bank. To share spectres between players, the players should join the same hideout area. After doing so, either player will be able to spawn spectral corpses of other players in the area.[3] In non-hideout areas, the player who owns the desired spectre must be the one to use Desecrate for other players.
