If 8% of maximum life cannot be removed (e.g. maximum life is 1 due to Chaos Inoculation), the spell can still be used and will lower the player to 1 life, but will lose part or all of the additional base damage scaling from life.[1] The more damage multiplier will always take effect when not casting on a skeleton, even if no life is actually sacrificed.

The skill tooltip does not factor the base damage from sacrificed life into its calculation as it is conditional.[2] Proxy: Proxies will attempt to target an allied skeleton if one is nearby. If not, the proxy will use Dark Pact sacrificing its own life; totems can scale this with totem life modifiers. Proxies will get the more damage bonus from using life if not targeting an allied skeleton.[3] Minion Instability: Dark Pact can be used to forcibly lower the life of your Skeleton minions to low life. Doing so will trigger the effect of the Keystone passive Minion Instability. Minion modifiers: Despite having the minion tag, there are no minion-specific support gems that can support Dark Pact, and modifiers that affect minion stats do not affect Dark Pact.
