Animate Guardian is a spell, animating weapons and armour on the ground to form an allied minion. Using this skill on an identified item on the ground creates an Animated Guardian that moves and attacks similar to a zombie. Similar to Spectres and unlike other minions, a Guardian stays with you even after logging off and on. If you unequip the skill gem, the Guardian disappears until you equip the gem again, at which point the same Guardian (retaining all its equipment) reappears after casting the spell again. This also holds true when swapping a different AG gem in. Socketing the gem in a weapon or shield slot allows you to recall the Guardian at will by switching weapon sets (default hotkey: X). You can only have one Guardian at a time. It can be equipped with a helmet, body armour, pair of gloves, pair of boots, a shield, and melee weapons.

Items containing skill gems cannot be animated, so the Guardian cannot use trigger gems. Items that have modifiers like +x to Maximum life or +x% increased Attack Speed, and even corrupted implicits, apply to the Guardian the same way they apply to player characters; so animating magic or rare equipment can potentially give you a very powerful minion. Unique items can also be used, giving guardians powerful abilities not found elsewhere in the game. Be careful when using valuable itemsâ€”anything you give to your guardian is gone forever. All modifiers on the items themselves apply to the Animated Guardian once animated, including enchantments, corrupted implicit modifiers, Scourge modifiers, and Crucible passive trees (except modifiers which allocate player notable passive skills, as minions do not have access to your passive tree). The Guardian uses weapons and shields in the same way as player characters, and can dual wield if two one-handed weapons are animated. If you animate an item type that the Guardian is already using (such as a helmet), the new item will overwrite the old one. Equipping an armour piece restores 25% of its life; equipping one-handed weapons or shields will alternate between left and right hand. You cannot equip two shields. The Guardian does not share your max amount of curses you can apply to enemies, and therefore functions as a player with the default curse limit when applying curses (through corrupted gloves, for example). Items: The Guardian's items are tied to the character that summoned it, rather than the gem itself. The gem can freely be changed around without risking loss of the Animate Guardian's equipment. Note that the skill's gem level determines the maximum level requirement of items the Animate Guardian can equip; if the gem's level is too low for an equipped item, it will disable the item temporarily until it is high enough gem level. This does not delete the equipped item.

This makes it very risky to use powerful or valuable items on an Animated Guardian. It is possible to prevent a body armour worn by a Guardian from being deleted upon Guardian death by crafting the Item drops on Death if Equipped by an Animated Guardian mod onto it; this will only cause that specific item to drop. It does not protect other equipped items. Note that equipment is not lost if the Animate Guardian is despawned, such as by removing the
