Rupture is a support gem that supports Attack skills, causing them to inflict a stack of Rupture if they deal a critical strike that also applies bleeding. Rupture is a debuff that causes enemies to take more damage from bleeding, but also causes bleeding to expire more quickly. Per its reminder text, Up to 3 Ruptures can be inflicted on a target, lasting 3 seconds each. Rupture dynamically applies to all bleeding debuffs on the target, even those that are not applied by supported skills. Rupture's effect on expiration rate is effectively multiplicative with effects that cause bleeding to deal damage faster, such as Sadism SupportSadism SupportSupportIcon: XLevel: (1-20)Cost & Reservation Multiplier: 130%Requires Level 18Supports any skill that hits enemies.Damaging Ailments inflicted with Supported Skills deal damage (60-79)% faster80% less Duration of Ailments inflicted with Supported Skills Additional Effects From 1-20% Quality: Supported Skills deal (0.5-10)% increased Damage over TimeThis is a Support Gem.
