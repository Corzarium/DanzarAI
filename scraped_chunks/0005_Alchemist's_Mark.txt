Alchemist's Mark is a spell that marks a single target with a curse. Hits against the marked target grant flask charges and when you ignite or poison the marked enemy, it leaves behind burning ground or caustic ground under them, respectively. Elemental Proliferation: Ignites that are proliferated from a nearby enemy or corpse to the marked target will not trigger the burning ground. Flask charges: Gain 1 Flask Charge when you Hit a Cursed Enemy grants charges to all flasks.[1] Proxies: hits from proxies, such as totems or traps, are unable to create this curse's ground effects. The duration of the burning and caustic ground are independent of the duration of the ignite or poison that applied it, making it work well with builds that use high-damage, low-duration ignite/poisons.
