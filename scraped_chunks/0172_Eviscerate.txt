Eviscerate is a retaliation melee attack skill that unleashes two arcing waves of force in front of the user that applies bleeding. This skill requires a shield and a sword or axe to use. This skill becomes usable after blocking a hit. Eviscerate fires two simultaneous rectangular damaging areas in a V shape in front of you.
