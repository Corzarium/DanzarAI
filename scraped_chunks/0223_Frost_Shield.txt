Frost Shield is a spell that creates a chilling area around the caster for a duration. The area drains your energy shield when initially cast, and uses the absorbed energy shield to redirect a percentage of the damage the user takes to itself while the user is within it. The user also gains increased spell critical strike chance while within the field. Chilling Area: Enemies that are inside the chilling area become chilled by the player. Modifiers to chill and cold/non-damaging ailments apply, including from support gems. It can apply chilled by you stats, enable if you have chilled recently stats, and cannot chill when the player or skill cannot chill. Energy Shield Recharge: Recharge is disabled while the effect is draining energy shield. Despite not being damage, the drain also interrupts ES recharge, which Wicked Ward may prevent.[1] Frost Shield can drop anywhere.
