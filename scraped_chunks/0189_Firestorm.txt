Firestorm is a spell that rains numerous fiery bolts in an area, each bolt dealing area of effect fire damage. Area of Effect: Increased AoE will increase both the area in which the fireballs randomly fall and also the radius of the individual fireball damage. Full spell damage is done at any point within the AoE of a fireball. However, increasing the size of the spell area means that each monster within the spell area is within fewer individual fireball bursts[1]; thus, less spell damage is dealt to any single enemy as area increases. For this reason increasing the AoE of Firestorm paradoxically decreases the average damage dealt to a single target. Duration: Increasing duration with either supports or passives will increase the total number of fireballs that fall before the spell ends. Damage Effectiveness: Damage from secondary sources like 'added damage' supports or heralds applies at only 80% of their listed value. Damage per Second: Due to the complexity of estimating actual DPS of the skill including all possible factors, ingame tooltip shows only average damage per hit of one fireball, with actual DPS of the skill being considerably higher. The closest currently available estimate can be obtained by using the damage calculator. Firestorm can drop anywhere.
