Inspiration Support is a support gem that lessens the mana cost of linked skills. When the supported skill is used, it grants an Inspiration Charge, which grants more elemental damage and increased critical strike chance to linked skills. You lose all Inspiration Charges after you spend a certain amount of mana. The mod of this gem: Supported Skills have #% less Mana Cost does not affect mana reservation. Supported skills grant you a Inspiration Charge when you spend mana with them, up to 5 charges. These charges last for 10 seconds. If you haven't generated a charge within those 10 seconds, you will lose all Inspiration Charges. Eldritch Battery: If used, the player will not gain inspiration charges until the energy shield pool is depleted and the mana (underneath the protective energy shield front-end/layer) is being spent.[1] This creates a mana counter for all skills linked with Inspiration Support, up to the respective cap. As soon as a skill is used that puts the total mana spent above the threshold, the mana counter is reset to 0 and all Inspiration Charges are removed. Hence lower mana costs result in better usage of Inspiration Charges. For example, if it takes 100 mana to cast a skill, the first 5 casts will average at 50% of the gem's potential and then the next 3 casts will be at 100% potential, while a mana cost of 1 will result in 795 casts at maximum efficiency after the first 5 initial casts. The less mana cost of skills is additive with other sources of less mana costs. The Inspiration Charges grants more elemental damage and increased critical strike chance per Charge to linked skill gems. Inspiration Charges are shared between all skills linked with Inspiration Support. It doesn't matter which skill created the charges, each skill linked to this support will benefit from the charges even if the skill doesn't use mana like Righteous FireRighteous FireSpell, AoE, FireLevel: (1-20)Cooldown Time: 0.30 secCan Store 1 Use(s)Cast Time: InstantRequires Level 16Engulfs you in magical fire that rapidly burns you and nearby enemies.
