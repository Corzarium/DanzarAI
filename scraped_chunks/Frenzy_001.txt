Frenzy is a ranged attack that grants frenzy charges on hit and also gains large bonuses from them. It requires a bow or wand. More Attack Damage per Frenzy Charge: Frenzy deals more hit damage based on the player's current charges. Damage is calculated before on-hit effects, including its own charge gain. Like most skills, Frenzy is limited in charge gain. Per attack or trigger, Frenzy can only gain 1 Frenzy charge from hits, regardless of multiple projectiles, mechanics like chain, or repeats from e.g. Fatal Flourish. Frenzy can drop anywhere.
