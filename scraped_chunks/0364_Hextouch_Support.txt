Hextouch Support is a support gem that causes a linked skill to apply linked hex(es) on hit. Hexes linked to Hextouch cannot be cast directly. Another linked skill that can hit enemies is required to enable the ability to curse enemies. Hexes are applied after the first hit; the first hit will not be affected by debuffs from the applied hex. Skills that hit multiple times will benefit from the hex after the first hit. Damage over time effects applied by a hexing hit (for example, Decay or ignite) will benefit from the hex. Hexes applied by supported skills no longer have an area of effect, as they only affect enemies hit with the skill. Minions, totems, mines, and traps cannot apply hexes linked to Hextouch Support. As Hextouch does not actually trigger the linked hex and instead applies the equivalent hex to an enemy, the player does not spend mana or other resources when the hex is applied. Hextouch is only considered a trigger for the linked hex and not the skill which is applying it (see Trigger). This means supporting a triggered skill (e.g. The Hidden BladeThe Hidden BladeAmbusherDaggerPhysical Damage: (62.7-68.4) to (244.2-266.4)Critical Strike Chance: 7.80%Attacks per Second: 1.50Weapon Range: 1.0 metresRequires Level 60, 113 Dex, 113 Int30% increased Global Critical Strike ChanceTrigger Level 20 Unseen Strike every 0.5 seconds while Phasing+(20-40) to Dexterity(230-260)% increased Physical Damage30% reduced Attack Speed while PhasingThe shadow warrior moves like the wind;his strikes land long after he is gone.'s Unseen Strike) does not disable that skill by giving it two triggers.
