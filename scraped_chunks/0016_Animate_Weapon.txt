Animate Weapon is a spell that animates a weapon on the ground as a flying allied minion. Animate Weapon can be used on identified melee weapons lying on the ground. Bows and Wands cannot be animated unless the threshold jewel Spirit GuardsSpirit GuardsViridian JewelLimited to: 1Radius: MediumMinions deal (8-12)% increased DamageWith at least 40 Dexterity in Radius, Animate Weapon can Animate up to 20 Ranged WeaponsLong after the Karui passed through, the whispers of those who stood their ground at Lioneye's Watch could be heard amongst the rubble.Place into an allocated Jewel Socket on the Passive Skill Tree.

If the "Key Pickup" option is enabled in the UI tab of the Options menu, the "Highlight items and objects" key may be held in order to animate specific weapons. Otherwise, the skill will attempt to animate a random valid weapon within a small area around the player's cursor. Attempting to animate a weapon with a level requirement higher than the maximum listed on the gem will cost mana and perform the cast animation, but will fail to create a minion.

All modifiers on the weapon item itself apply to the minions once animated, including enchantments, corrupted implicit modifiers, Scourge modifiers, and Crucible passive trees (except modifiers which allocate player notable passive skills, as minions do not have access to your passive tree). There are different calculations for weapons summoned from items on the ground and lingering blades from spells. Weapons inherit the hit damage, attack speed and critical strike chance of the weapon they are summoned from. This includes any direct modifiers to base stats, such as 108% increased Physical Damage, which are factored into the base damage of the minion. The minion then gains additional Physical damage based on gem level, which is not scaled by weapon local modifiers. The additional damage for Lingering Blades does not apply to animated itemized weapons. Other weapon-specific stats found on the weapon (such as Attacks with this Weapon Penetrate 12% Elemental Resistances or 25% increased Elemental Damage with Attacks are additive with similar sources of stats for minions. Note that modifiers to Minions on animated weapons will have no effect on the Animate Weapon minion itself, as Animated Weapon is considered using the weapon, and has no minions of its own.
