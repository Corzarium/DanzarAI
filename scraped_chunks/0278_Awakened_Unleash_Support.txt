The damage multiplier of reoccur portion of the cast, depends on how often the skill is cast and can be estimated (for a lvl 5 gem) using the following equation: 100 % âˆ’ 38 % 0.66 second \color [rgb]{0.6392156862745098,0.5529411764705883,0.42745098039215684}{\dfrac {100\%-38\%}{0.66{\text{second}}}} or approximately: 6.06 % less DPS \color [rgb]{0.6392156862745098,0.5529411764705883,0.42745098039215684}{6.06\%{\text{ less DPS}}} This assume the player have matching cast time that equal to 0.66 second : 1.51 cast per second to achieve this dps for reoccur portion of the cast. This does not take into account of gem quality Supported Skills deal 0.5% increased Spell Damage (per 1% quality) which is multiplicative with Supported Skills deal (40-38)% less Damage when Reoccurring.
