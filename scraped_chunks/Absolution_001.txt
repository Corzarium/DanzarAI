Absolution is a skill that damages enemies in an area, applying a debuff for a short duration. If a non-unique enemy dies while affected by the debuff, the enemy's corpse will be consumed to summon a friendly Sentinel of Absolution minion for a longer secondary duration, or to refresh the duration and life of an existing one instead if you have the maximum number of them.
