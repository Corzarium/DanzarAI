Corrupting Cry Support is a support gem that causes Corrupted Blood to be inflicted on enemies in the supported warcryâ€™s radius or attacks exerted by the supported warcry. The supported warcry has less area of effect and costs life instead of mana to use (with a very high cost multiplier). Corrupted Blood Corrupting Cry applies 4 stacks of Corrupted Blood on nearby enemies when you warcry, and 1 stack on exerted attacks, up to a total of 10 from all sources. Corrupted Blood debuff duration refreshes when a stack is gained, even from other sources such as Corrupting FeverCorrupting FeverSpell, Duration, PhysicalLevel: (1-20)Cost: (78-520) LifeCooldown Time: 1.00 secCan Store 1 Use(s)Cast Time: InstantRequires Level 16Draws out your own blood to power a buff for a duration, letting this skill inflict the Corrupting Blood debuff on enemies you hit, dealing physical damage over time for a short secondary duration.

Corrupting Cry modifies the properties of the linked warcry, enabling supports that would not otherwise be able to support the warcry to be linked.
