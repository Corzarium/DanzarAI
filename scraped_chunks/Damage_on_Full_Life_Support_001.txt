Damage on Full Life is a support gem that grants more damage made with the supported attacks, but only when the player (or minion) is on full life. Being even one life below the maximum will nullify the effect, unless the player uses something like Life Mastery to lower the threshold for "full life". The gem only improves the supported skill's damage if the player is on full life.
