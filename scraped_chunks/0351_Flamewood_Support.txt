Flamewood Support is a support gem that causes totems to trigger Avenging Flame when hit by an enemy, which fires a mortar into the air, dealing fire damage in an area around the target that hit it. Avenging Flame is a triggered fire projectile spell that fires a projectile into the air that falls around the enemy that hit the totem, dealing damage in an area.

While Avenging Flame is the player's skill (granting it the player's offensive stats), it is triggered from totems; on-hit effects will be granted to the totem it triggered from, and Ancestral Bond will not prevent its damage. Additional projectiles create additional damaging areas, allowing for area overlap to hit the same target. The recommended number of projectiles against a single target is 5 projectiles, similar to Forbidden Rite's primary projectile mechanic.[confirmation needed] Avenging Flame cannot be triggered through reflect or self-hitting with Eye of InnocenceEye of InnocenceCitrine AmuletRequires Level 68+(16-24) to Strength and Dexterity10% chance to Ignite(50-70)% increased Damage while IgnitedTake 100 Fire Damage when you Ignite an Enemy2% of Fire Damage Leeched as Life while Ignited"...and so He said: 'Let only the good meet my gaze'and no eye met His.
