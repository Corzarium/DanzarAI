Decay Support is a support gem that makes hits from supported skills inflict Decay, a chaos damage over time debuff. Decay is a chaos damage over time debuff. It is not affected by modifiers to skill effect duration[1] and does not add a duration to supported skills. Since Decay is a debuff, only one instance will ever apply at a time - it does not stack. The highest damage active instance of the debuff will apply. Reapplying the debuff will refresh the duration. Decay damage is considered damage from the supported skill, and is affected by all relevant modifiers of that skill, including global stats from the player, stats from support gems, and stats inherent to the active skill. Examples of applicable modifiers are #% more/less/increased/reduced Damage/Chaos Damage/Damage over Time, but also skill-specific modifiers that affect all of a skill's damage, such as Storm BurstStorm BurstAoE, Spell, Lightning, Channelling, Duration, PhysicalLevel: (1-20)Cost: (2-5) ManaCast Time: 0.25 secCritical Strike Chance: 6.00%Effectiveness of Added Damage: 35%Requires Level 12Unleash orbs of energy while you channel that repeatedly jump towards the targeted location until their duration expires, dealing damage in small area after each jump.
