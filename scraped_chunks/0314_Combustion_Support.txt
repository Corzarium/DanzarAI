Combustion is a support gem that grants supported skills that grants more fire damage and chance to ignite the enemy. Enemies ignited by the supported skill have reduced fire resistance for the duration of the ignite applying Combustion. Note that even though this skill 'Supports any skill that hits enemies', by default only fire damage can ignite. Therefore it by default only helps skills dealing fire damage, see more on ignite, including uniques that enable other elements to ignite. The fire damage could be supplied by gear or for minions for instance a jewel with 'Minions deal additional Fire Damage'. The Chance to Ignite an enemy given by this gem is independent of the chance to ignite an enemy as a result of a critical strike. The overall probability that an enemy will be ignited is: ChanceToIgnite = 1 − ( 1 − SkillCritChance ) ∗ ( 1 − SkillIgniteChance ) \color [rgb]{0.6392156862745098,0.5529411764705883,0.42745098039215684}{\text{ChanceToIgnite}}=1-(1-{\text{SkillCritChance}})*(1-{\text{SkillIgniteChance}}) It is worth noting that as opposed to chance to critical strike, which is checked once for each cast of the skill, the chance to ignite is checked separately for each individual hit.
